The driver is also a function, and it takes a stream of requests as\n\t * input, and outputs an HTTP Source, an object with some functions to query for\n\t * response streams.\n\t *\n\t * **Requests**. The stream of requests should emit either strings or objects.\n\t * If the stream emits strings, those should be the URL of the remote resource\n\t * over HTTP. If the stream emits objects, these should be instructions how\n\t * superagent should execute the request. These objects follow a structure\n\t * similar to superagent's request API itself. `request` object properties:\n\t *\n\t * - `url` *(String)*: the remote resource path. **required**\n\t * - `method` *(String)*: HTTP Method for the request (GET, POST, PUT, etc).\n\t * - `category` *(String)*: an optional and arbitrary key that may be used in\n\t * the HTTP Source when querying for the response. E.g.\n\t * `sources.http.select(category)`\n\t * - `query` *(Object)*: an object with the payload for `GET` or `POST`.\n\t * - `send` *(Object)*: an object with the payload for `POST`.\n\t * - `headers` *(Object)*: object specifying HTTP headers.\n\t * - `accept` *(String)*: the Accept header.\n\t * - `type` *(String)*: a short-hand for setting Content-Type.\n\t * - `user` *(String)*: username for authentication.\n\t * - `password` *(String)*: password for authentication.\n\t * - `field` *(Object)*: object where key/values are Form fields.\n\t * - `progress` *(Boolean)*: whether or not to detect and emit progress events\n\t * on the response Observable.\n\t * - `attach` *(Array)*: array of objects, where each object specifies `name`,\n\t * `path`, and `filename` of a resource to upload.\n\t * - `withCredentials` *(Boolean)*: enables the ability to send cookies from the\n\t * origin.\n\t * - `agent` *(Object)*: an object specifying `cert` and `key` for SSL\n\t * certificate authentication.\n\t * - `redirects` *(Number)*: number of redirects to follow.\n\t * - `lazy` *(Boolean)*: whether or not this request runs lazily, which means\n\t * the request happens if and only if its corresponding response stream from the\n\t * HTTP Source is subscribed to. By default this value is false: requests run\n\t * eagerly, even if their response is ignored by the application.\n\t *\n\t * **Responses**. A metastream is a stream that emits streams. The HTTP Source\n\t * manages response metastreams. These streams of responses have a `request`\n\t * field attached to them (to the stream object itself) indicating which request\n\t * (from the driver input) generated this response streams. The HTTP Source has\n\t * functions `filter()` and `select()`, but is not itself a stream. So you can\n\t * call `sources.HTTP.filter(request => request.url === X)` to get a new HTTP\n\t * Source object which is filtered for response streams that match the condition\n\t * given, and may call `sources.HTTP.select(category)` to get a metastream of\n\t * response that match the category key. With an HTTP Source, you can also call\n\t * `httpSource.select()` with no param to get the metastream. You should flatten\n\t * the metastream before consuming it, then the resulting response stream will\n\t * emit the response object received through superagent.\n\t *\n\t * @return {Function} the HTTP Driver function\n\t * @function makeHTTPDriver\n\t */\n\tvar http_driver_1 = __webpack_require__(167);\n\texports.makeHTTPDriver = http_driver_1.makeHTTPDriver;\n\t//# sourceMappingURL=index.js.map\n\n/***/ },\n/* 169 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\t\"use strict\";\n\tObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", { value: true });\n\tfunction isolateSource(httpSource, scope) {\n\t    if (scope === null) {\n\t        return httpSource;\n\t    }\n\t    return httpSource.filter(function (request) {\n\t        return Array.isArray(request._namespace) &&\n\t            request._namespace.indexOf(scope) !== -1;\n\t    });\n\t}\n\texports.isolateSource = isolateSource;\n\tfunction isolateSink(request$, scope) {\n\t    if (scope === null) {\n\t        return request$;\n\t    }\n\t    return request$.map(function (req) {\n\t        if (typeof req === 'string') {\n\t            return { url: req, _namespace: [scope] };\n\t        }\n\t        req._namespace = req._namespace || [];\n\t        req._namespace.push(scope);\n\t        return req;\n\t    });\n\t}\n\texports.isolateSink = isolateSink;\n\t//# sourceMappingURL=isolate.js.map\n\n/***/ },\n/* 170 */\n/***/ function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\t\"use strict\";\n\tvar xstream_1 = __webpack_require__(25);\n\tvar XStreamAdapter = {\n\t    adapt: function (originStream, originStreamSubscribe) {\n\t        if (XStreamAdapter.isValidStream(originStream)) {\n\t            return originStream;\n\t        }\n\t        ;\n\t        var dispose = null;\n\t        return xstream_1.default.create({\n\t            start: function (out) {\n\t                var observer = out;\n\t                dispose = originStreamSubscribe(originStream, observer);\n\t            },\n\t            stop: function () {\n\t                if (typeof dispose === 'function') {\n\t                    dispose();\n\t                }\n\t            },\n\t        });\n\t    },\n\t    makeSubject: function () {\n\t        var stream = xstream_1.default.create();\n\t        var observer = {\n\t            next: function (x) { stream.shamefullySendNext(x); },\n\t            error: function (err) { stream.shamefullySendError(err); },\n\t            complete: function () { stream.shamefullySendComplete(); },\n\t        };\n\t        return { observer: observer, stream: stream };\n\t    },\n\t    remember: function (stream) {\n\t        return stream.remember();\n\t    },\n\t    isValidStream: function (stream) {\n\t        return (typeof stream.addListener === 'function' &&\n\t            typeof stream.shamefullySendNext === 'function');\n\t    },\n\t    streamSubscribe: function (stream, observer) {\n\t        stream.addListener(observer);\n\t        return function () { return stream.removeListener(observer); };\n\t    },\n\t};\n\tObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", { value: true });\n\texports.default = XStreamAdapter;\n\t//# sourceMappingURL=index.js.map\n\n/***/ },\n/* 171 */\n/***/ function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\t\"use strict\";\n\tvar base_1 = __webpack_require__(165);\n\tvar xstream_adapter_1 = __webpack_require__(170);\n\t/**\n\t * Takes a `main` function and circularly connects it to the given collection\n\t * of driver functions.\n\t *\n\t * **Example:**\n\t * ```js\n\t * import {run} from '@cycle/xstream-run';\n\t * const dispose = run(main, drivers);\n\t * // ...\n\t * dispose();\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * The `main` function expects a collection of \"source\" streams (returned from\n\t * drivers) as input, and should return a collection of \"sink\" streams (to be\n\t * given to drivers).

If you need to compare emissions over time,\n * cache the values with `map` first:\n *\n * ```js\n * import pairwise from 'xstream/extra/pairwise'\n *\n * const stream1 = xs.of(1);\n * const stream2 = xs.of(2);\n *\n * xs.combine(stream1, stream2).map(\n *   combinedEmissions => ([ ...combinedEmissions ])\n * ).compose(pairwise)\n * ```\n *\n * @factory true\n * @param {Stream} stream1 A stream to combine together with other streams.\n * @param {Stream} stream2 A stream to combine together with other streams.\n * Multiple streams, not just two, may be given as arguments.\n * @return {Stream}\n */\nStream.combine = function combine() {\n    var streams = [];\n    for (var _i = 0; _i < arguments.length; _i++) {\n        streams[_i] = arguments[_i];\n    }\n    return new Stream(new Combine(streams));\n};\nexports.Stream = Stream;\nvar MemoryStream = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(MemoryStream, _super);\n    function MemoryStream(producer) {\n        var _this = _super.call(this, producer) || this;\n        _this._has = false;\n        return _this;\n    }\n    MemoryStream.prototype._n = function (x) {\n        this._v = x;\n        this._has = true;\n        _super.prototype._n.call(this, x);\n    };\n    MemoryStream.prototype._add = function (il) {\n        var ta = this._target;\n        if (ta !== NO)\n            return ta._add(il);\n        var a = this._ils;\n        a.push(il);\n        if (a.length > 1) {\n            if (this._has)\n                il._n(this._v);\n            return;\n        }\n        if (this._stopID !== NO) {\n            if (this._has)\n                il._n(this._v);\n            clearTimeout(this._stopID);\n            this._stopID = NO;\n        }\n        else if (this._has)\n            il._n(this._v);\n        else {\n            var p = this._prod;\n            if (p !== NO)\n                p._start(this);\n        }\n    };\n    MemoryStream.prototype._stopNow = function () {\n        this._has = false;\n        _super.prototype._stopNow.call(this);\n    };\n    MemoryStream.prototype._x = function () {\n        this._has = false;\n        _super.prototype._x.call(this);\n    };\n    MemoryStream.prototype.map = function (project) {\n        return this._map(project);\n    };\n    MemoryStream.prototype.mapTo = function (projectedValue) {\n        return _super.prototype.mapTo.call(this, projectedValue);\n    };\n    MemoryStream.prototype.take = function (amount) {\n        return _super.prototype.take.call(this, amount);\n    };\n    MemoryStream.prototype.endWhen = function (other) {\n        return _super.prototype.endWhen.call(this, other);\n    };\n    MemoryStream.prototype.replaceError = function (replace) {\n        return _super.prototype.replaceError.call(this, replace);\n    };\n    MemoryStream.prototype.remember = function () {\n        return this;\n    };\n    MemoryStream.prototype.debug = function (labelOrSpy) {\n        return _super.prototype.debug.call(this, labelOrSpy);\n    };\n    return MemoryStream;\n}(Stream));\nexports.MemoryStream = MemoryStream;\nObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", { value: true });\nexports.default = Stream;\n//# sourceMappingURL=index.js.map\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/xstream/index.js\n// module id = 25\n// module chunks = 0","/**\n * Copyright (c) 2013-present, Facebook, Inc.\n * All rights reserved.\n *\n * This source code is licensed under the BSD-style license found in the\n * LICENSE file in the root directory of this source tree.

The driver is also a function, and it takes a stream of requests as\n * input, and outputs an HTTP Source, an object with some functions to query for\n * response streams.\n *\n * **Requests**. The stream of requests should emit either strings or objects.\n * If the stream emits strings, those should be the URL of the remote resource\n * over HTTP. If the stream emits objects, these should be instructions how\n * superagent should execute the request. These objects follow a structure\n * similar to superagent's request API itself. `request` object properties:\n *\n * - `url` *(String)*: the remote resource path. **required**\n * - `method` *(String)*: HTTP Method for the request (GET, POST, PUT, etc).\n * - `category` *(String)*: an optional and arbitrary key that may be used in\n * the HTTP Source when querying for the response. E.g.\n * `sources.http.select(category)`\n * - `query` *(Object)*: an object with the payload for `GET` or `POST`.\n * - `send` *(Object)*: an object with the payload for `POST`.\n * - `headers` *(Object)*: object specifying HTTP headers.\n * - `accept` *(String)*: the Accept header.\n * - `type` *(String)*: a short-hand for setting Content-Type.\n * - `user` *(String)*: username for authentication.\n * - `password` *(String)*: password for authentication.\n * - `field` *(Object)*: object where key/values are Form fields.\n * - `progress` *(Boolean)*: whether or not to detect and emit progress events\n * on the response Observable.\n * - `attach` *(Array)*: array of objects, where each object specifies `name`,\n * `path`, and `filename` of a resource to upload.\n * - `withCredentials` *(Boolean)*: enables the ability to send cookies from the\n * origin.\n * - `agent` *(Object)*: an object specifying `cert` and `key` for SSL\n * certificate authentication.\n * - `redirects` *(Number)*: number of redirects to follow.\n * - `lazy` *(Boolean)*: whether or not this request runs lazily, which means\n * the request happens if and only if its corresponding response stream from the\n * HTTP Source is subscribed to. By default this value is false: requests run\n * eagerly, even if their response is ignored by the application.\n *\n * **Responses**. A metastream is a stream that emits streams. The HTTP Source\n * manages response metastreams. These streams of responses have a `request`\n * field attached to them (to the stream object itself) indicating which request\n * (from the driver input) generated this response streams. The HTTP Source has\n * functions `filter()` and `select()`, but is not itself a stream. So you can\n * call `sources.HTTP.filter(request => request.url === X)` to get a new HTTP\n * Source object which is filtered for response streams that match the condition\n * given, and may call `sources.HTTP.select(category)` to get a metastream of\n * response that match the category key. With an HTTP Source, you can also call\n * `httpSource.select()` with no param to get the metastream. You should flatten\n * the metastream before consuming it, then the resulting response stream will\n * emit the response object received through superagent.\n *\n * @return {Function} the HTTP Driver function\n * @function makeHTTPDriver\n */\nvar http_driver_1 = require(\"./http-driver\");\nexports.makeHTTPDriver = http_driver_1.makeHTTPDriver;\n//# sourceMappingURL=index.js.map\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/@cycle/http/lib/index.js\n// module id = 168\n// module chunks = 0","\"use strict\";\nObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", { value: true });\nfunction isolateSource(httpSource, scope) {\n    if (scope === null) {\n        return httpSource;\n    }\n    return httpSource.filter(function (request) {\n        return Array.isArray(request._namespace) &&\n            request._namespace.indexOf(scope) !== -1;\n    });\n}\nexports.isolateSource = isolateSource;\nfunction isolateSink(request$, scope) {\n    if (scope === null) {\n        return request$;\n    }\n    return request$.map(function (req) {\n        if (typeof req === 'string') {\n            return { url: req, _namespace: [scope] };\n        }\n        req._namespace = req._namespace || [];\n        req._namespace.push(scope);\n        return req;\n    });\n}\nexports.isolateSink = isolateSink;\n//# sourceMappingURL=isolate.js.map\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/@cycle/http/lib/isolate.js\n// module id = 169\n// module chunks = 0","\"use strict\";\nvar xstream_1 = require('xstream');\nvar XStreamAdapter = {\n    adapt: function (originStream, originStreamSubscribe) {\n        if (XStreamAdapter.isValidStream(originStream)) {\n            return originStream;\n        }\n        ;\n        var dispose = null;\n        return xstream_1.default.create({\n            start: function (out) {\n                var observer = out;\n                dispose = originStreamSubscribe(originStream, observer);\n            },\n            stop: function () {\n                if (typeof dispose === 'function') {\n                    dispose();\n                }\n            },\n        });\n    },\n    makeSubject: function () {\n        var stream = xstream_1.default.create();\n        var observer = {\n            next: function (x) { stream.shamefullySendNext(x); },\n            error: function (err) { stream.shamefullySendError(err); },\n            complete: function () { stream.shamefullySendComplete(); },\n        };\n        return { observer: observer, stream: stream };\n    },\n    remember: function (stream) {\n        return stream.remember();\n    },\n    isValidStream: function (stream) {\n        return (typeof stream.addListener === 'function' &&\n            typeof stream.shamefullySendNext === 'function');\n    },\n    streamSubscribe: function (stream, observer) {\n        stream.addListener(observer);\n        return function () { return stream.removeListener(observer); };\n    },\n};\nObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", { value: true });\nexports.default = XStreamAdapter;\n//# sourceMappingURL=index.js.map\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/@cycle/xstream-adapter/lib/index.js\n// module id = 170\n// module chunks = 0","\"use strict\";\nvar base_1 = require('@cycle/base');\nvar xstream_adapter_1 = require('@cycle/xstream-adapter');\n/**\n * Takes a `main` function and circularly connects it to the given collection\n * of driver functions.\n *\n * **Example:**\n * ```js\n * import {run} from '@cycle/xstream-run';\n * const dispose = run(main, drivers);\n * // ...\n * dispose();\n * ```\n *\n * The `main` function expects a collection of \"source\" streams (returned from\n * drivers) as input, and should return a collection of \"sink\" streams (to be\n * given to drivers).
