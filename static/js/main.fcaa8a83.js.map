which, when called, returns a HTTP Driver for Cycle.js\n\t * apps. The driver is also a function, and it takes a stream of requests as\n\t * input, and outputs an HTTP Source, an object with some functions to query for\n\t * response streams.\n\t *\n\t * **Requests**. The stream of requests should emit either strings or objects.\n\t * If the stream emits strings, those should be the URL of the remote resource\n\t * over HTTP. If the stream emits objects, these should be instructions how\n\t * superagent should execute the request. These objects follow a structure\n\t * similar to superagent's request API itself. `request` object properties:\n\t *\n\t * - `url` *(String)*: the remote resource path. **required**\n\t * - `method` *(String)*: HTTP Method for the request (GET, POST, PUT, etc).\n\t * - `category` *(String)*: an optional and arbitrary key that may be used in\n\t * the HTTP Source when querying for the response. E.g.\n\t * `sources.http.select(category)`\n\t * - `query` *(Object)*: an object with the payload for `GET` or `POST`.\n\t * - `send` *(Object)*: an object with the payload for `POST`.\n\t * - `headers` *(Object)*: object specifying HTTP headers.\n\t * - `accept` *(String)*: the Accept header.\n\t * - `type` *(String)*: a short-hand for setting Content-Type.\n\t * - `user` *(String)*: username for authentication.\n\t * - `password` *(String)*: password for authentication.\n\t * - `field` *(Object)*: object where key/values are Form fields.\n\t * - `progress` *(Boolean)*: whether or not to detect and emit progress events\n\t * on the response Observable.\n\t * - `attach` *(Array)*: array of objects, where each object specifies `name`,\n\t * `path`, and `filename` of a resource to upload.\n\t * - `withCredentials` *(Boolean)*: enables the ability to send cookies from the\n\t * origin.\n\t * - `agent` *(Object)*: an object specifying `cert` and `key` for SSL\n\t * certificate authentication.\n\t * - `redirects` *(Number)*: number of redirects to follow.\n\t * - `lazy` *(Boolean)*: whether or not this request runs lazily, which means\n\t * the request happens if and only if its corresponding response stream from the\n\t * HTTP Source is subscribed to. By default this value is false: requests run\n\t * eagerly, even if their response is ignored by the application.\n\t *\n\t * **Responses**. A metastream is a stream that emits streams. The HTTP Source\n\t * manages response metastreams. These streams of responses have a `request`\n\t * field attached to them (to the stream object itself) indicating which request\n\t * (from the driver input) generated this response streams. The HTTP Source has\n\t * functions `filter()` and `select()`, but is not itself a stream. So you can\n\t * call `sources.HTTP.filter(request => request.url === X)` to get a new HTTP\n\t * Source object which is filtered for response streams that match the condition\n\t * given, and may call `sources.HTTP.select(category)` to get a metastream of\n\t * response that match the category key. With an HTTP Source, you can also call\n\t * `httpSource.select()` with no param to get the metastream.

If you need to compare emissions over time,\n * cache the values with `map` first:\n *\n * ```js\n * import pairwise from 'xstream/extra/pairwise'\n *\n * const stream1 = xs.of(1);\n * const stream2 = xs.of(2);\n *\n * xs.combine(stream1, stream2).map(\n *   combinedEmissions => ([ ...combinedEmissions ])\n * ).compose(pairwise)\n * ```\n *\n * @factory true\n * @param {Stream} stream1 A stream to combine together with other streams.\n * @param {Stream} stream2 A stream to combine together with other streams.\n * Multiple streams, not just two, may be given as arguments.\n * @return {Stream}\n */\nStream.combine = function combine() {\n    var streams = [];\n    for (var _i = 0; _i < arguments.length; _i++) {\n        streams[_i] = arguments[_i];\n    }\n    return new Stream(new Combine(streams));\n};\nexports.Stream = Stream;\nvar MemoryStream = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(MemoryStream, _super);\n    function MemoryStream(producer) {\n        var _this = _super.call(this, producer) || this;\n        _this._has = false;\n        return _this;\n    }\n    MemoryStream.prototype._n = function (x) {\n        this._v = x;\n        this._has = true;\n        _super.prototype._n.call(this, x);\n    };\n    MemoryStream.prototype._add = function (il) {\n        var ta = this._target;\n        if (ta !== NO)\n            return ta._add(il);\n        var a = this._ils;\n        a.push(il);\n        if (a.length > 1) {\n            if (this._has)\n                il._n(this._v);\n            return;\n        }\n        if (this._stopID !== NO) {\n            if (this._has)\n                il._n(this._v);\n            clearTimeout(this._stopID);\n            this._stopID = NO;\n        }\n        else if (this._has)\n            il._n(this._v);\n        else {\n            var p = this._prod;\n            if (p !== NO)\n                p._start(this);\n        }\n    };\n    MemoryStream.prototype._stopNow = function () {\n        this._has = false;\n        _super.prototype._stopNow.call(this);\n    };\n    MemoryStream.prototype._x = function () {\n        this._has = false;\n        _super.prototype._x.call(this);\n    };\n    MemoryStream.prototype.map = function (project) {\n        return this._map(project);\n    };\n    MemoryStream.prototype.mapTo = function (projectedValue) {\n        return _super.prototype.mapTo.call(this, projectedValue);\n    };\n    MemoryStream.prototype.take = function (amount) {\n        return _super.prototype.take.call(this, amount);\n    };\n    MemoryStream.prototype.endWhen = function (other) {\n        return _super.prototype.endWhen.call(this, other);\n    };\n    MemoryStream.prototype.replaceError = function (replace) {\n        return _super.prototype.replaceError.call(this, replace);\n    };\n    MemoryStream.prototype.remember = function () {\n        return this;\n    };\n    MemoryStream.prototype.debug = function (labelOrSpy) {\n        return _super.prototype.debug.call(this, labelOrSpy);\n    };\n    return MemoryStream;\n}(Stream));\nexports.MemoryStream = MemoryStream;\nObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", { value: true });\nexports.default = Stream;\n//# sourceMappingURL=index.js.map\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/xstream/index.js\n// module id = 87\n// module chunks = 0","// @flow\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport styled from \"styled-components\";\n\nimport { TEXT_COLOR } from '../styles';\n\nconst BackButton = styled.button`\n  border: 0;\n  background: transparent;\n  cursor: pointer;\n`;\nconst Svg = styled.svg`\n  width: 3em;\n  height: 3em;\n`;\nconst Path = styled.path`\n  fill: ${TEXT_COLOR};\n`;\n\nexport default ({ onClick }: {onClick: Function}) => (\n  <BackButton onClick={onClick}>\n    <Svg viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\">\n      <Path fill=\"none\" d=\"M8.388,10.049l4.76-4.873c0.303-0.31,0.297-0.804-0.012-1.105c-0.309-0.304-0.803-0.293-1.105,0.012L6.726,9.516c-0.303,0.31-0.296,0.805,0.012,1.105l5.433,5.307c0.152,0.148,0.35,0.223,0.547,0.223c0.203,0,0.406-0.08,0.559-0.236c0.303-0.309,0.295-0.803-0.012-1.104L8.388,10.049z\"></Path>\n    </Svg>\n  </BackButton>\n);\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/components/BackButton.js","'use strict';\n\n/**\n * Copyright (c) 2013-present, Facebook, Inc.\n *\n * Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n * you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n * You may obtain a copy of the License at\n *\n * http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n *\n * Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n * distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n * WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n * See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n * limitations under the License.\n *\n * @typechecks\n */\n\nvar emptyFunction = require('./emptyFunction');\n\n/**\n * Upstream version of event listener.

The driver is also a function, and it takes a stream of requests as\n * input, and outputs an HTTP Source, an object with some functions to query for\n * response streams.\n *\n * **Requests**. The stream of requests should emit either strings or objects.\n * If the stream emits strings, those should be the URL of the remote resource\n * over HTTP. If the stream emits objects, these should be instructions how\n * superagent should execute the request. These objects follow a structure\n * similar to superagent's request API itself. `request` object properties:\n *\n * - `url` *(String)*: the remote resource path. **required**\n * - `method` *(String)*: HTTP Method for the request (GET, POST, PUT, etc).\n * - `category` *(String)*: an optional and arbitrary key that may be used in\n * the HTTP Source when querying for the response. E.g.\n * `sources.http.select(category)`\n * - `query` *(Object)*: an object with the payload for `GET` or `POST`.\n * - `send` *(Object)*: an object with the payload for `POST`.\n * - `headers` *(Object)*: object specifying HTTP headers.\n * - `accept` *(String)*: the Accept header.\n * - `type` *(String)*: a short-hand for setting Content-Type.\n * - `user` *(String)*: username for authentication.\n * - `password` *(String)*: password for authentication.\n * - `field` *(Object)*: object where key/values are Form fields.\n * - `progress` *(Boolean)*: whether or not to detect and emit progress events\n * on the response Observable.\n * - `attach` *(Array)*: array of objects, where each object specifies `name`,\n * `path`, and `filename` of a resource to upload.\n * - `withCredentials` *(Boolean)*: enables the ability to send cookies from the\n * origin.\n * - `agent` *(Object)*: an object specifying `cert` and `key` for SSL\n * certificate authentication.\n * - `redirects` *(Number)*: number of redirects to follow.\n * - `lazy` *(Boolean)*: whether or not this request runs lazily, which means\n * the request happens if and only if its corresponding response stream from the\n * HTTP Source is subscribed to. By default this value is false: requests run\n * eagerly, even if their response is ignored by the application.\n *\n * **Responses**. A metastream is a stream that emits streams. The HTTP Source\n * manages response metastreams. These streams of responses have a `request`\n * field attached to them (to the stream object itself) indicating which request\n * (from the driver input) generated this response streams. The HTTP Source has\n * functions `filter()` and `select()`, but is not itself a stream. So you can\n * call `sources.HTTP.filter(request => request.url === X)` to get a new HTTP\n * Source object which is filtered for response streams that match the condition\n * given, and may call `sources.HTTP.select(category)` to get a metastream of\n * response that match the category key. With an HTTP Source, you can also call\n * `httpSource.select()` with no param to get the metastream. You should flatten\n * the metastream before consuming it, then the resulting response stream will\n * emit the response object received through superagent.\n *\n * @return {Function} the HTTP Driver function\n * @function makeHTTPDriver\n */\nvar http_driver_1 = require('./http-driver');\nexports.makeHTTPDriver = http_driver_1.makeHTTPDriver;\n//# sourceMappingURL=index.js.map\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/@cycle/http/lib/index.js\n// module id = 159\n// module chunks = 0","\"use strict\";\nfunction isolateSource(httpSource, scope) {\n    return httpSource.filter(function (request) {\n        return Array.isArray(request._namespace) &&\n            request._namespace.indexOf(scope) !== -1;\n    });\n}\nexports.isolateSource = isolateSource;\nfunction isolateSink(request$, scope) {\n    return request$.map(function (req) {\n        if (typeof req === 'string') {\n            return { url: req, _namespace: [scope] };\n        }\n        req._namespace = req._namespace || [];\n        req._namespace.push(scope);\n        return req;\n    });\n}\nexports.isolateSink = isolateSink;\n//# sourceMappingURL=isolate.js.map\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/@cycle/http/lib/isolate.js\n// module id = 160\n// module chunks = 0","\"use strict\";\nvar base_1 = require('@cycle/base');\nvar xstream_adapter_1 = require('@cycle/xstream-adapter');\n/**\n * Takes a `main` function and circularly connects it to the given collection\n * of driver functions.\n *\n * **Example:**\n * ```js\n * import {run} from '@cycle/xstream-run';\n * const dispose = run(main, drivers);\n * // ...\n * dispose();\n * ```\n *\n * The `main` function expects a collection of \"source\" streams (returned from\n * drivers) as input, and should return a collection of \"sink\" streams (to be\n * given to drivers).
